# Prediction_MNIST
This project is aimed to predict handwriting which dataset is provided by kaggle

Here the following path of our project:
1. Read data by converting original dataset into numpy using idx2numpy
2. data exploration
3. data split
4. implement model
5. fit model and evaluate model
6. hyperparameter tuning  and visualize data
7. predict images

this stage cover all steps mentioned above
